# Evaluating-Target-Markets-with-Summary-Statistics

In this project, I evaluate a dataset to determine the best markets in which to advertise a fake company's products and services.
To do this, I'll combine knowledge of the company's products with statistical analysis of consumer preferences and possible markets.
The project involves use of basic summary statistics and dealing with outliers.
